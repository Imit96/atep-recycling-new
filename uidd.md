# ðŸŒ± ATEP Recycling - User Interface Description Document (UIDD)

## Layout Structure

The interface follows a **modular, section-based layout** designed to guide users through content in a structured yet engaging way. Each page is divided into scrollable sections with clear visual hierarchy. The main navigation appears at the top with a **hamburger menu for mobile and dropdown expandables for desktop**, allowing easy access to sub-pages like certifications or collection process details.

## Core Components

- **Header**: Fixed top bar with logo, main navigation, and contact button.
- **Hero Section**: Full-width banner on homepage with bold title, brief description, and call-to-action.
- **Interactive Sections**: Use of **accordions, tabs, and step-by-step modules** to explain processes like recycling methods or how to partner.
- **Cards & Grids**: Used for displaying products, certifications, and associations in an organized layout.
- **Footer**: Contains quick links, social media icons, and legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms).
- **Admin Panel UI**: Simple dashboard layout with sidebar navigation and form sections for editing content.

## Interaction Patterns

- **Expandable Menus**: Dropdowns in navigation reveal subpages and internal links.
- **Accordion Panels**: Clickable sections that expand to show more detailed information.
- **Tabbed Interfaces**: Allow switching between related content blocks (e.g., different product categories).
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations on buttons and cards to indicate interactivity.
- **Scroll Animations**: Elements fade-in or slide as user scrolls down the page for a dynamic feel.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

- **Primary Colors**: Soft greens (#6B8F71, #A8D8B9) paired with neutral whites and light greys for a clean, eco-friendly look.
- **Accent Colors**: Earthy orange (#FFA500) used sparingly for calls to action and highlights.
- **Icons & Illustrations**: Custom or open-source SVG icons and minimal line illustrations to explain complex topics visually.
- **Backgrounds**: Light gradients and subtle textures to add depth without distraction.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations

- **Mobile**: Fully responsive design with stacked layouts, collapsible menus, and touch-friendly buttons.
- **Tablet**: Optimized grid layouts and readable font sizes.
- **Desktop**: Wider screen space allows for side-by-side content and enhanced hover interactions.
- All components are built using **responsive Tailwind CSS classes** to ensure consistent display across devices.

## Typography

- **Headings**: Bold sans-serif typeface (e.g., Inter or Poppins) for modern clarity.
- **Body Text**: Clean, readable sans-serif font with sufficient line spacing for long-form content.
- **Font Sizes**: Scalable text using relative units (rem) for accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Text Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body copy to support skimmability.

## Accessibility

- **Contrast Ratios**: Text and background colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (menus, accordions, forms) are accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML structure and ARIA labels used throughout.
- **Alt Text**: Placeholder descriptions included for all images and icons.
